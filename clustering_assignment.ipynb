        "\n",
        "->Yes, but not directly with distance measures like Euclidean.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use hierarchical clustering on categorical data:\n",
        "\n",
        "Convert to suitable distance metric (e.g., Hamming distance, Jaccard distance), or\n",
        "\n",
        "Use algorithms designed for categorical data (e.g., k-modes, hierarchical clustering with Gower distance**).\n",
        "\n",
        "So: possible, but requires special distance measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.What does a negative Silhouette Score indicate?\n",
        "\n",
        "->A negative Silhouette Score means:\n",

        "\n",
        "The clustering is poor or incorrect.\n",
        "\n",
        "Clusters overlap badly or K is wrongly chosen.\n",

        "\n",
        "->Linkage criteria define how the distance between clusters is measured when merging them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common types:\n",
        "\n",
        "Single Linkage → min distance between points of two clusters\n",

        "\n",
        "->K-Means performs poorly on data where clusters have different sizes, densities, or shapes because:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. K-Means Assumes Equal-Sized, Spherical Clusters\n",
        "\n",
        "K-Means uses Euclidean distance and centroid averaging, which naturally forms round and similarly sized clusters.\n",
        "It cannot correctly separate:\n",

        "\n",
        "One dense cluster and one sparse cluster\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Centroid Position Gets Pulled Toward Large or Dense Clusters\n",
        "\n",
        "Large or dense clusters have more points, so their centroid attracts nearby smaller clusters, causing incorrect assignments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Points From Sparse Clusters Get Assigned to Dense Clusters\n",
        "\n",
        "Since K-Means optimizes distance to centroids, it often pushes points from a low-density cluster into a high-density cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Fixed K Value Cannot Capture Density Variation\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "(1) ε (Epsilon) – Neighborhood Radius\n",
        "\n",
        "Defines how close points must be to be considered neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Small ε → many small clusters, more noise\n",
        "\n",
        "Large ε → fewer large clusters, merges everything\n",
        "\n",
        "(2) minPts – Minimum Points Required to Form a Dense Region\n",
        "\n",
        "Defines how many points must lie within ε to form a core point.\n",
        "\n",
        "Low minPts → detects small clusters but may include noise\n",
        "\n",
        "High minPts → stable clusters but may miss small ones\n",
        "\n",
        "Influence on Clustering\n",
        "\n",
        "Points inside a dense ε-neighborhood become core points.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regions reachable through core points form clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Points that are not core or border → noise/outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.How does K-Means++ improve upon standard K-Means initialization?\n",
        "\n",
        "->K-Means++ improves cluster initialization by selecting better initial centroids.\n",
        "\n",
        "Working:\n",

        "\n",
        "->Agglomerative clustering is a type of hierarchical clustering that works in a bottom-up manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "Start with each data point as an individual cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "Merge the two closest clusters based on a distance measure.\n",

        "\n",
        "->Inertia:\n",
        "\n",
        "Only measures compactness of clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Always decreases as K increases → cannot judge cluster separation.\n",
